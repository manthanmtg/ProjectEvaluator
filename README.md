This app eases the task of evaluating the projects of the students.
## Features of the app:
  1. Team details can be uploaded directly from google sheets using a unique sheetID.
  2. Easy to use UI.
  3. Viewing marks of individual team is now easy no need to look for the team number in the longgg sheet.
  4. Entering marks is way simple than any other trivial methods.
  5. App is protected using password. Anyone with access to the phone can't access the app making it more secured.
  6. A spreadsheet containing the team details along with the marks can be saved locally for further evaluation.
  7. Help page is given to easily debug an error.
  8. The app is developed very cautiously so that there no errors. Still no app is fully bug free. Contact Us page is given so that 
      you can directly mail us the problem so that we can rectify the error.
  9. A very huge number of teams can be handled in an easy way.

## Topics covered while developing app:
  1. Shared Preferences for storing password.
  2. Google Sheets API for importing the team details.
  3. SQLite database for working internally with marks of teams.
  4. A third party library called SQLite2Excel for converting SQLite to .xls file.
  5. Usage of different layouts such as TableLayout, ConstraintLayout, LinearLayout etc...

## Further development:
  1. UI can be made look more fresh.
  2. Making app even more interactive.
  3. Preventing users making mistakes while entering marks in the early stages only.
  4.
